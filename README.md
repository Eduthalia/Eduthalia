Hello, World! 🌍👩‍💻


I’m a coding enthusiast and part-time chocolate connoisseur, diving deep into the world of Software Engineering! When I'm not busy crafting user-friendly apps like Silesua, you can find me dreaming up design ideas or mentoring the next generation of tech-savvy women at She Codes.

I have a knack for turning chocolate into code ☕💻 and enjoy exploring new technologies—especially anything that helps create seamless user experiences. One line of code at a time! 🌈🚀

Feel free to browse my repositories, leave a star ⭐, or just say hi!
